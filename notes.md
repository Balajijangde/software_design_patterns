# Creational design patterns:

Prototype -> when we need to provide clone function for a class, we can create a Prototype interface (with a clone function having return type as Prototype) and all the clonable classes will implement that interface and return their own Clone by copying all parameters.

Singleton -> when we want only 1 instance of a class throughout the application.

Factory -> It is used when all the object creation and its business logic we need to keep at one place

Abstract factory -> It returns factory of factory

Builder -> When you want to create object step by step, multiple steps, which becomes complex just using constructor parameters

# Structural design patterns:

It is a way to combine or arrange different classes and objects to form a complex or bigger structure to solve a particular requirement

Decorator pattern -> This pattern helps to add more functionality to existing object, without changing its structure

Proxy pattern -> This pattern helps to provide control access to original object
